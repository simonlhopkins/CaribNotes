The front suspension is sorta squeaky, and it could be the actual struts, or it could be the tie rods, but I should probably just replace both.
KBY is the brand that makes many OEM Toyota parts
Looks like it'll be 200-300$

front left part number W0133-1952022
- $168.97 on parts geek
front right part number W0133-1952021
- $195.97 on [parts geek](https://www.partsgeek.com/)

Probably just need jack and jack stand.
