I had a lot of luck with the site https://doclingo.ai
So far I only spent 2$ to buy more tokens, and it has OCR (Optical Character Recognition) support.
I did not like deepL, and google translate with PDF only works if the text is embedded in the PDF or something. I think you'd have to convert your pdf to a JPEG.
