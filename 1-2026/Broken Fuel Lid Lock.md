When reaching over to buy a parking ticket, I placed my foot on the fuel lid lock lever, and snapped it right off. It doesn’t look like the exact part [77306-13060](https://toyota.epc-data.com/sprinter_carib/ae115g/19170/body/7701/77306/) is for sale anymore. So I think I am going to try to [plastic weld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYN1pwN5a8) it together with wire mesh. There probably are other OEM parts that would work for this since it is literally just pulling a lever.

This was a [helpful link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neUJGVvVGs0) in understanding how the seat bolt clips function. In order to access the [FUEL LID LOCK](https://toyota.epc-data.com/sprinter_carib/ae115g/19170/body/7701/77306/) I had to remove in this order

1. The seat bolt covers
2. The seat, remove the seat from the car
3. Remove the trim by the driver’s side door. The silver “Carib” decal is attached with double sided tape. The plastic trim piece is connected through a series of clips.
4. Remove one of the clips that is holding the wires. There are 2 clips revealed when you remove the trim, I only had to remove the one closest to the back of the car. I could then prey the carpet open to reveal the bolt for the lever, and the hole which the lever can be removed.
5. The lever itself.
    

Removing the plastic clips was easily the hardest part, and I don’t know if I’ll even put the bolt covers back on. Bike tire levers were very helpful for removing the bolt covers.

Also it seemed like it would be convenient for the carpet to contain a flap, so the lever can more easily be accessed in the future. I would need to be careful that it is tight, since I wouldn’t want water/dirt to get beneath the floor.

I was then able to remove the lever, remove the pink clip that is holding the wire to the mechanism FIRST. I was tugging on the wire to get it out and I heard a different part of it, hopefully just under the carpet, come loose. Remove the PINK clip, then remove the wire. I could then easily pull on the wire.

  

I pointed the wire so it would be accessible when the seat was reinstalled. I then reinstalled the seat so I can drive it to get gas since the gas is really low. I did NOT reinstall the trim, the clip to hold in the wires, or the plastic trim piece, since I would just need to remove them again when I reinstall the mechanism.

I am next going to try to plastic weld it back together so I can use a part that looks as OEM as possible. I also think the flap might not be a bad idea at all.

When I uninstalled everything, I kept the plastic trim piece and the bolt covers off which was a great idea.
I removed the seat again, and then tried to make some space above the slot where it goes to put it back in. It was honestly pretty difficult, but with enough fiddling around I eventually got it through. I thought it would be a good idea to tie a string to the lever and feed that through first to make things easier but that did not work. Once I got the lever through, lining the bolt up was not too hard.
When I had the seat removed, I also added grease to the tracks for forward/backward adjustment which actually helped a lot. Next time I have the seat out I should add grease to the angle adjust mechanism.
I found 100 yen underneath the carpet!!

It broke again :^( I do not remember stepping on it, but I don't think putting the epoxy in the holes between the crack actually did anything. Oh well. I think I'll make the slit in the carpet because I am thinking of putting a bike brake lever in the place of it. I think that a machined metal brake lever would be much more durable, but the only trouble is I have no idea how I'd secure it. Maybe I'll try 3D printing or something. Anyways such is life and I though I did a pretty good job initially, but I'll inspect it when I take it out a and hopefully learn. The good news bout the epoxy is I basically make a smooth continuous surface to adhere it to if I want to reattach the plastic.

got a brake lever from bike farm to install. I think it'll look pretty slick, but I need to 3d print a part to bridge the gap and attach it to the existing screw hole. I think that I will use prong nuts, or heat inserts. I think prong nuts will be best, and I learned this from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEEtk85rAY).
