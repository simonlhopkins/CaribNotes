I replaced the engine air filter with [this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/204777153537) I got off of ebay. It seems to fit perfectly fine, although I am a little bummed it looks like it came from China, and the one installed was a Denso branded one made in Japan lol.
I was able to replace it without unhooking the air intake tube, and just be mindful of the small tubes that sit above the air intake tube. I have no idea what those do
