I ordered a [LCD polarizer replacement](amazon.com/dp/B0F55DNZXC?pd_rd_i=B0F555X33V&pf_rd_p=c8b39f81-ded8-4d75-80c2-6dfa03cbb699&pf_rd_r=W0S7DFQS83J9A1EJ2EYG&pd_rd_wg=irnvP&pd_rd_w=S1G3C&pd_rd_r=b95805a7-a7e9-4682-b38f-a169ee41dc34&th=1) off of amazon. I also ordered [2 connectors ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJQVHQGG?psc=1&smid=A3AW9SXBAGUYPG&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp)
that look like one will work for audio and one will work for video. I am not sure why each of them have 3 inputs, but I am hoping that I would just plug a single wire into the video, and then and then the other 2 wires into the audio.
