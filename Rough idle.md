I've noticed the idle is a little "buzzy" or bumpy when it is either idling above or below ~700 RPM

Apparently you can hook up a power source to one of the pins and ground to the other to watch the idle control open/close when it is disconnected from the car.

I purchased the following gaskets from https://autoparts.beavertontoyota.com/. They can be picked up in beaverton which is super convienient. It makes sense to replace the gaskets since they are definitely something that degrade over time. Once they come in, I'll buy some throttle body cleaner, and take the throttle body off, clean it, then take the IAC off, and test it.
I should get some 8mm bolts prior to this so I can plug the coolant lines that attach to the
